<h2>Modelling transmissible cancer</h2>

Student(s): Falter, F., Linders, L., Ludwig, D., Raff, T., Salam, J.;
Supervisor(s): Katerina Stankov&aacute; and Frank Thuijsman;



<h4>Problem Statement and Motivation:</h4>
The research questions that will be addressed during this project are as follow:
<ol>
<li>What types of models, and ways of mathematically modelling exist to model DFTD1 and DFTD2 on a population of Tasmanian Devils?</li>
<li>Can a mathematical model, when combined with spatial data, be used to make a spatial, agent-based, representation of the spread of DFTD1 and DFTD2?</li>
<li>Can a trade-off be found between complexity and comprehensibility in the spatial model, such that the impact of the tweaking of specific variables can still be found?</li>
<li>How complex does an agent-based spatial model have to be, in order to be an accurate representation of a population of Tasmanian Devils?</li>
</ol>
